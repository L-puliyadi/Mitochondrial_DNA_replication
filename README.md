# Mitochondrial_DNA_replication
Bachelor Thesis Research 2021

A systems biology approach for the identifying novel mitochondrial DNA replication and maintainance candidate proteins was used. It relied on the construction of protein-protein interaction networks and their expansion with transcriptional factors.

For this two scripts were used, Project_Network_Analysis and Project_Network_Setting. 
Former constructs protein-protien interaction networks across 16 different settings (encompassing different combinations of confidence scores and number of protein interactors)
Latter introduces transcriptional factors into the protein-protein interaction networks.

All files needed to run the scripts are provided as well.
